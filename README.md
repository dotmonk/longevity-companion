## Basic idea
Create a structure with and for the data important when looking to increase longevity referencing the source material for all data (N/A where there are no studies done so it's only guesswork)while allowing the user to disable sources they deem unreliable and enabling sources they deem reliable while having defaults which seems reasonably safe.

## Intial plan
- Typescript
- React
- Localstorage
- Import + Export support with old versions backed up and deletable
- Extend React Component for global state management(for fun)
- Personal information which may effect different factors
    - Gender
    - Weight
    - Age
    - Conditions
        - IBS

- Start some data/resources/studies surounding these topics:
    - NNR
    - RDI
    - Vitamin D+K2
    - Collagen
    - Creatine
    - Excersize and heart health etc
    - Balance
    - BMI
    - Foods
    - Sunscreen
    - Cancers
    - Mortality risks
